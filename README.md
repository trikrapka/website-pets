### Prerequisite
Install latest version of nodejs & mongoDB(database) into your PC for this to work. I have explained the installation process below refer to it and when you're done:

You now just need to open terminal and write these commands:

* ### `git clone https://github.com/ `
* navigate to where you downloaded the repository and install all the requirements- `npm install` 
* ### `node app.js` 
If all goes well and you configure all the required modules correctly, this will run the whole node.js coded project and you will see the blog website on your local servers(https://localhost:3000/)

# MongoDB Installation 
## Download the msi file based on your platform(windows, mac, linux etc) [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
## Install
* Select the latest version and click download.
* After downloding the file double click it, and install it in complete mode.
* Note the data directory I recommend you not to change and keep it default.
* Uncheck Install mongodb compass, we don't need it for now.
* Click Install now. 

## Configure
After successfully installing the latest version you need to configure the database to use it.

* Navigate to your C:// drive or /home in linux 
* Create a folder and name it "data" (make sure to name it exactly)
* Now make another folder inside this folder named "db" (make sure to name it exactly)
The path should now appear like this:
### C:\data\db
Now set alias to your database based on your database directory in your C drive.
* `cd ~ `
* `touch .bash_profile`
* now open this bash file and set alias (mongo = "just paste the directory")
